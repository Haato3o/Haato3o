## About me

I'm a 22 year old guy who is highly interested in coding, reverse engineering and making software. I dropped out of my computer science bachelor degree after a year and been working as a backend engineer since 2021 at PicPay, one of the biggest Brazilians fintech.

When I'm not working, I'm either developing my personal projects, reverse engineering or just playing video games. The project I'm the most proud of is HunterPie, an easy-to-use and modern, yet very robust, overlay for Monster Hunter games with a couple thousands of active users daily, feel free to check them out.

## My stack

I don't actually have a pet language although `C#`, `Python`, `C++` and `Golang` have a special place in my heart. Besides those, I've also coded in a lot of other languages, including: `Lua`, `Rust`, `Kotlin`, `JavaScript` and even `Assembly (x86)`. I love learning new languages and also diving deep into how they're made and how they work, so I'm pretty flexible about that.

Besides languages, I also have knowledge in `Docker` (docker compose is a bless), `Kafka`, `Microservices`, `AWS`, `MySQL`, `MongoDB`, `RabbitMq`, `Jenkins` and other CI/CD tools too. For monitoring I'm experienced with both `Datadog` and `New Relic`.
